  ### Money Matters

  Our client, the [Madeira Story Centre (SC)](http://www.storycentre.com/), a museum that focuses on the history and culture of Madeira, asked us to help their struggling business. The museum is comprised of a traditional exhibit and a store. Given it's location in the heart of old town Funchal, its store does very well, but the museum itself is flailing.  We were to understand the discrepancy, and create a service design concept that would help increase revenues of both the museum and the shop.

  ### I Want to Break Free (From Winter)

  Roughly 5 million tourists visit Madeira each year, almost all of whom want to enjoy Madeira's lovely weather and outdoors. Thus we created Pirate Planning, a scavenger hunt type game where tourists pick personalized coins based on their interests both around the museum and the shop. By the end of the experience, tourists receive a personalized itinerary of things to do on the island, and the cultural and historical context to make it memorable.

    <p>Given the Story Centre's prime location, we were initially confused about why it wasn't doing better. We created a customer journey map to get a holistic feel of the experience, and reconciled it with on-site observation and interviews. We interviewed 17 people, patrons who stopped by the Story Centre cafe (but decided not to see the museum) along with other tourists in this popular part of the city. </p>
    <p>We also looked through reviews and performed a quick competitive analysis (CA) just to get a better idea of the attractions that the museum was up against.</p>
    <p>Interview questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How did you find out about the Story Centre?
      <li>What brings you here? (the store? the museum?)
      <li>If not the museum, why isn't it a consideration?
      <li>What do you plan on doing on the island during your visit?
    </ul>

    <p>Each of the methods brought their own unique set of insights. These included:</p>

    <h3 class="special">- The bright spots -</h3>

    <p>"It could be a fantastic start to your holiday or business visit to Madeira. An amazing way to see Madeira throughout its history" - Tripadvisor</p>

    <h3 class="special">- Missed opportunities -</h3>

    <p>"Is this a museum? I didn't even realize, I just thought it was just a store" - Interview</p>
    <p>"It had a great terrace at the top to see the views of the city and it was near to the sea, the cable car and it is right in the middle of the old town." - Tripadvisor </p>

    <h3 class="special">- The real desires -</h3>

    <p>"No, we'll have to pass on the museum. We just want to walk by the ocean today." - Interview</p>
    <p>Nine of the top ten main attractions are outdoor ones. - Competitive analysis</p>

        <p>Given the wave of different types of tourists we created personas to capture their commonality and differences. Given the severity of financial issues, we used these personas to guide design solutions. Our solution needed to be flexible enough to serve the range of tourists, so both young and old, tourists who hoped to see the main attractions and tourists who were looking for something different.</p>

    <p>We started with low-hanging fruit: extend hours, make use of patio on upper deck, create more inviting physical space for museum entrance. We then played with various marketing ideas: increase brand recognition and become the cultural center for all of Madeira. Our final solution extended the Story Center's service to "Recommended for You" activities via a kiosk. It would combine existing rich content on Madeira's history and extended them slightly to activities tourists could potentially be interested in.</p>
    <p>To the right are various iterations of the final vision. We pared down this idea of an extensive tourist center, with planning and booking, to just an interactive kiosk that could filter attractions based on defined interests. Instead of QR codes and smart phones, we liked the idea of using something tangible (so RFID tokens) and fun (a themed scavenger hunt). We also added a human actor, the pirate, to really bring the adventure to life in a real way.</p>
