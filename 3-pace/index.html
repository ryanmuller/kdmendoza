  ### Why We Exercise

  We all know the benefits of an active lifestyle, but as great as the endorphins are, do we really do just for our physical health? Our research clearly says no. *We exercise to push limits, to find quiet, and to reconnect with ourselves.* How might a system that respects all these facets look like?
solution: |
  ### Hey Soul System!

  Pace is a digital ecosystem that allows runners of all motivations to find songs that match both their mood and running pace. One can use it casually, and solely get songs that match their mood; or she can use it as a teaching instrument, to help keep pace.

  Do you find yourself exercising for the one-on-one time it allows just as much as for the kick the endorphins? Let Pace, a running product and mobile application, transform the way you see exercise.
  
  This was the final project for Tools for User Experience Design in collaboration with [Chelsea Kim](http://chelseakim.com/portfolio.html) and Jocelyne Hsia, where I was the product manager and user researcher.

    <h2>Needfinding</h2>

    <p>In this open-ended design assignment, we wanted to focus on activities we knew we should do, but didn't do enough.  We settled on exercise, specifically running because of its accessibility.</p>

    <p>We scoured the market, and <strong><em>talked to lots of people</em></strong>. They told us about when they ran, why they ran, what they enjoyed, and what they didn't.  The research methods include various make-tools, where we combined storytelling, collages and maps, and extreme users.</p>

  <h2>Insights</h2>

  <p><em>Running was not only a physical activity: it was a ritual users performed reconnect with themselves. It helped them distress, explore, gather thoughts, escape. Music heightened these experiences.</em></p>

  <p>Other themes included:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>People had issues with the current technology, both physical music player and digital music applications</li>
    <li>People gave running its own slot, preferably in the morning or in the evening, when they weren’t pressed for time </li>
    <li> Some listened to music while running, to keep running pace</li>
    <li>And most found that the music they listened to had some impact on their mood, either it reflected what they were feelings or elicited what they wanted to feel. The physical act of running and music mood heightened the awareness of the emotion.</li>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>How can we alter the physical ergonomics of mp3 player to allow for
    user control, giving the user the option to seamlessly change beats
    per minute and mood of music?</p>
    <p> How can we use running performance to dynamically optimize
    playlist?</p>
    <p>How can we leverage the human qualities of music such that
    runner may tune into their current emotions?</p>

    <h2>Final</h2>
    
    <p>We created both a physical product and a mobile application
    that includes all of these elements. The product is an
    ergonomically designed mp3 player that syncs with your smart phone,
    which hold all the relevant data from your run.</p>

    <p>Its characteristics are:</p>

    <p><strong>User control:</strong> A user selects desired beats per minute (BPM)
    and mood of before run. It would also allow for seamless
    interaction during the run, if they wanted to change these
    elements.</p>

    <p><strong>Dynamic Optimization:</strong> If a user’s pace did not match BPM, previously liked ‘power’ songs, would play to help motivate the user. “Power” songs could be manually liked, but Pace would have the option of automatically liking songs that a user kept BPM with.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection and Sharing:</strong> This attribute of the program is
    less about current running and playlist problems, but more about
    the user holistic well-being. Pace would allow a user to connect
    with current emotions and reflect on those, during or after the
    time of the run. It would also allow them to share music with
    their friends, if so desired.</p>
