    <p>Hi, I'm Kristine, and am finishing my last semester in Human-Computer
    Interaction at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Madeira. I am
    passionate about creating technology and digital experiences that 'gets'
    people.</p>

    <p>I get asked this a lot: <em>how'd you end up in HCI?</em></p>

    <p>My journey into HCI was incredibly fortuitous and unexpected. It came
    through teaching inner city students in NYC.  After many failed attempts
    at trying to teach them via traditional educational methods, I was
    forced to changed strategies. As I designed personal lesson plans based
    on personalities, likes, and current capabilities, I found myself
    relying more on technology. (Read: lots of Wikipedia!) We watched spoken
    word give a modern spin on poetry, played the Oregon Trail to discuss
    the lives of early settlers, and raced penguins to drill down
    multiplication tables.  I loved how with a little listening and the
    appropriate technology, people can feel heard. And with that a UX
    Designer was born.</p>
