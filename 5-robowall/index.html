  ### Dungeons and Robots

  At one of the toughest Computer Science universities  in the world, it's easy to get caught up and focus solely on your own project, sometimes for months on end. Research, however, supports the importance of collaboration and recognition for a project's success. How can technology promote this?
solution: |
  ### Awareness and Ease is Key

  Robowall showcases the amazing work, events, and people within in the Robotics Institute and Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) via a three panel touchscreen. CMU students who wish to upload their work are directed to a web portal where their work is reviewed and pushed.

  Robowall is an interactive screen-based installation designed to let the awesome work of the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics department flow outside the lab, exposing passers-by to sweet robots and changing a commute through a building into an opportunity to inspire collaboration.

  This was the final project for Spontaneous Design in collaboration with Jason Block and Susan Buenafe, where I was the user researcher and interaction designer.
