  ### A Blank Page 

  For our 8 month Capstone project, [our client](http://wowsystems.pt/), a Portuguese startup gave us an open-ended design opportunity. We were asked to understand writers - their gripes, joys, process, hiccups - and create a new type of writing experience.

  This application will be launched in the Apple store in early 2014
solution: |
  ### Shuffle

  Writers have a real need to move pieces of their ideas and writing around. Shuffle helps them not only play with structure, but also plot, alternatives and versions.

    <h2>Creativity & Constraints</h2>

    <p>One of the main lessons human-centered design has taught me is
    that constraints are an imperative part of creativity and thus,
    creation.</p>

    <p>In this open ended design assignment, we set our constraints
    constraints early. As designers who thrive on the creative process,
    we decided to focus on those who share our passion: creative
    writers. </p>

    <p>This was paired with our research plan into a 'hunt statement,' to
    understand the creative writing process using informal interviews
    and directed storytelling on aspiring and established writers and
    educators.'  </p>

    <h2>Research & Its Synthesis</h2>

    <p>Since writing is an internal process, our research heavily relied
    on other targeted research methods. These included:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>secondary research</strong> (what do experts have to say)
      <li><strong>directed storytelling</strong> (what do real life writers have to say about their writing process)
      <li><strong>creative writing workshops</strong> (what can we learn by undergoing the process ourselves)
    </ul>

    <p>In a proliferated market, we also performed a thorough
    <strong>competitive analysis</strong> to gauge the existing products and try to find
    areas of opportunities.</p>

    <p>Lastly, since we live in Portugal (and do not speak Portuguese)
    we used <strong>remote user-research</strong> for those in the US, and traditional
    methods during research trips to England.   </p>

    <h2>Insights & Concepts</h2>

    <p>We created affinity diagrams to get to major themes and insights,
    which included a writer's need for community, revision, playfulness,
    and a sweet spot.</p>

    <p>These insights were then turned into four concepts and, along
    with the research, were presented to the client. Our client decided
    on the writers need to shuffle and play with ideas, writing,
    alternatives and versions.</p>

    <p>We then generated <strong>over 50 product ideas</strong> around this concept, where
    our client then again chose 3 for better product definition. </p>

    <p>These 3 were:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Storyarc, a story management tool where plots are placed on the story arc to provide structure
      <li>Sliding Doors: a way to view alternatives to your story
      <li>Lens Cap: a character development tool where pieces of the story are told through a specific character's lens
    </ul>
