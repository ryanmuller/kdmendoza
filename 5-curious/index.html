title: Curious Interactions
dirname: 5-curious
tagline: A digital magazine that fosters the creative in all of us, be it the writer, illustrator, poet, activist, or reader. 
challenge: |
  ### Creative Collaboration

  Technology today makes collaboration easily accessible. In this project, however, where we were asked to create a digital magazine, we also wanted to make collaboration fun for all those involved, most especially the creators, curators and readers!
solution: |
  ### Clean for the Curious

  After our concept was selected, an e-magazine for designers and artists who wished to collaborate, we ran several iterations on interaction and visual design. We opted to keep the solution clean and sleek, so their creativity can speak can for itself.

  A digital iPad magazine that combines the power of curated storytelling and artistic design.

  This was the final project for Interaction Design Fundamentals in collaboration with Kiran Lokhande and Anshul Goyal, where I was the researcher and visual designer.

    <h2>Concept</h2>

    <p>For this project were to scout the market, create a concept,
    and produce several pages of an iPad magazine.</p>

    <p>Upon closer look of the text, we were instantly inspired!
    We enjoyed its playfulness and how the vividness of the story
    naturally engaged our other senses. Within three
    paragraphs, we were freezing in the woods, anxiously watching
    standoff between the aloof owls and cavalier ravens. That is the
    power of good text, it not only conjures images, but through
    how its story elicits genuine emotion.</p>

    <p>Thus our magazine would be a tribute to storytelling. It would
    be a place artists and writers could collaborate, and discuss
    their work and inspiration. They magazine itself would be
    minimalistic, allowing the work to shine. </p>

  <h2>Personas As Guides</h2>

  <p>We used personas to give us a better picture of our creative
  readers. They are open-minded, curious intellectuals, unafraid of
  atypical collaboration. Rather, they gladly welcome it! These readers
  are multi-faceted; they enjoy the fiction, non-fiction, and political
  cartoons in the New Yorker. They seek to understand both the business
  and design sections of Fast Company, revel in technology and the
  Middle East pages in the Economist, and adore Anna Wintour’s From the
  Editor remarks just as much as the runway photos.</p>

    <h2>Visual Iteration & Design Deliverable</h2>
    <p>I remember my first time in Venice. Maybe it was was because it
    was 7am in the middle of February, but there was something about the
    expanse of the courtyard, combined with the stone masonry of Saint
    Mark’s Basilica and the majestic clock tower, that just seemed to
    work. </p>

    <p>Similarly all elements of the magazine’s visual design, including
    concept, colors, layout, fonts, information hierarchy, and
    illustrations, were deliberately chosen for a cohesive feel. Since
    the power of visual design lies in its ability to evoke emotions,
    each element was considered individually as well as collectively.
    Some considerations were:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>General layout of the magazine? Given that artists and writers
      are collaborating, how much room would the editors have to alter
      the layout to make the magazine look cohesive? Would there be
      consistent sections, like an artist feature, that would be written
      and designed by staff?</li>
      <li>Books use serif font, but sans-serif looks better on a digital
      screen. Which to choose?</li>
      <li>Colors choice - Would it appeal to our personas? Did it uphold
      the timelessness of storytelling?</li>
      <li>Would we include photographs, or just illustrations? Were the
      illustrations for this issue cohesive?</li>
    </ul>
