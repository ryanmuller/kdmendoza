tagline: In a land as beautiful as Madeira, it's easy to see why indoor exhibits like the Story Centre don't do well. Thus, we created Pirate Planning, a new service that helps bridge the gap.

  ### Money Matters

  In a semester long project, our client, the [Madeira Story Centre (SC)](http://www.storycentre.com/), a museum that focuses on the history and culture of Madeira, asked us to help their struggling business. The museum is comprised of a traditional exhibit and a store. Given it's location in the heart of old town Funchal, its store does very well, but the museum itself is flailing.  We were to understand the discrepancy, and creae a service design concept that would help increase revenues of both the museum and the shop.

  ### I Want to Break Free (From Winter)

  Roughly 5 million tourists visit Madeira each year, almost all of whom want to enjoy Madeira's lovely weather and outdoors. Thus we created Pirate Planning, a scavenger hunt type game where tourists pick personalized coins based on their interests both around the museum and the shop. By the end of the experience, tourists receive a personalized itinerary of things to do on the island, and the cultural and historical context to make it memorable.
